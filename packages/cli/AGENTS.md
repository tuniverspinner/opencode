# V2 CLI and TUI development guide

## Migration context

- The TUI is being ported from legacy APIs to the new V2 APIs. New and migrated TUI behavior should use `sdk.client.v2` and the location-scoped data in `packages/tui/src/context/data.tsx` instead of adding dependencies on legacy sync state.
- Preserve established TUI behavior unless the task intentionally changes it. When behavior, copy, keyboard interaction, or layout is unclear, compare the local V2 TUI with the latest released legacy TUI.
- Run both versions in separate Terminal Control sessions and save PNG-only captures at equivalent states:

```bash
# From packages/cli: local V2 TUI
termctrl start opencode-v2-dev --host opentui --cols 112 --rows 34 -- bun dev --standalone

# Released legacy TUI behavior reference
termctrl start opencode-legacy --host opentui --cols 112 --rows 34 -- bunx opencode-ai@latest

termctrl save opencode-v2-dev --format png --out /tmp/opencode/v2.png
termctrl save opencode-legacy --format png --out /tmp/opencode/legacy.png
```

- Use the same viewport and send equivalent inputs to both sessions before comparing screenshots. The released CLI is a behavioral reference, not a source of V2 API design; keep the local implementation on V2 endpoints.
- Stop both sessions after comparison: `termctrl stop opencode-v2-dev` and `termctrl stop opencode-legacy`.

## Interactive debugging

- This package is the V2 CLI adapter. Run its `dev` script when testing the TUI; do not use the repository-root `bun dev`, which launches the legacy `packages/opencode` CLI.
- Run commands from `packages/cli`. Use `bun dev --standalone` for most debugging so the TUI starts with a private V2 server instead of depending on the background service.
- Use `termctrl` for interactive checks instead of starting the TUI as a blocking foreground process. It provides a real PTY, handles OpenTUI's host handshake, and can save reviewable screenshots.
- Use a dedicated session name and do not reuse or kill an unrelated session.

```bash
termctrl start opencode-v2-dev --host opentui --cols 112 --rows 34 -- bun dev --standalone
termctrl wait opencode-v2-dev "Ask anything" --timeout 20000
termctrl show opencode-v2-dev
```

- Wait for visible text before interacting instead of relying on fixed sleeps. Use the text expected from the screen under test, such as `Ask anything` or `Connect a provider`.
- Drive the running TUI with `termctrl send`. Prefix typed input with `text:` and send control keys separately so the interaction matches real terminal input.

```bash
termctrl send opencode-v2-dev 'text:example prompt' enter
termctrl send opencode-v2-dev ctrl-c
```

- Use `termctrl show` after each meaningful interaction and inspect the full visible screen for rendering errors, stale state, error toasts, and unexpected exits.
- Save PNG evidence for every user-visible bug and fix. Do not save text captures; inspect the rendered PNG. Write temporary captures outside the repository unless the artifact is intended to be committed.

```bash
termctrl save opencode-v2-dev --format png --out /tmp/opencode/v2-tui.png
```

- For resize-sensitive changes, resize the viewport, wait for the expected content, and capture the screen again:

```bash
termctrl resize opencode-v2-dev --cols 100 --rows 30
termctrl show opencode-v2-dev
```

- Source changes may require restarting the process. Use `termctrl restart opencode-v2-dev` rather than assuming the running TUI reloaded the change.
- To exercise background-service behavior, omit `--standalone`. Service lifecycle commands are available through `bun dev service start`, `bun dev service status`, and `bun dev service stop`.
- Always clean up the Terminal Control session when the check is complete:

```bash
termctrl stop opencode-v2-dev
```

## Debugger

- To debug the V2 CLI or TUI with Bun's inspector, launch the CLI entrypoint through Terminal Control with an inspector URL, then attach a debugger to that URL:

```bash
termctrl start opencode-v2-debug --host opentui --cols 112 --rows 34 -- \
  bun run --inspect=ws://localhost:6499/ src/index.ts --standalone
```

- Use `--inspect-wait` or `--inspect-brk` when execution must pause until the debugger attaches.
- Use `termctrl logs opencode-v2-debug` for inspector output or startup failures emitted before the TUI renderer starts. Use `termctrl show` for the visible full-screen TUI.

## Verification

- Run `bun typecheck` from `packages/cli` after CLI adapter changes.
- Run `bun typecheck` and `bun test` from `packages/tui` after shared TUI changes. Do not run tests from the repository root.
- Treat automated checks and Terminal Control smoke tests as complementary. For user-visible changes, verify initial render, the changed interaction, Ctrl-C exit behavior, and save a screenshot of the corrected state.
