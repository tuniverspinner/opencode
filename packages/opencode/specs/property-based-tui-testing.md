# Property-Based TUI Testing

Status: first-pass implementation plan.

The goal is to drive the TUI against the real opencode app/backend while replacing external effects with deterministic simulation boundaries. The first pass should produce the smallest end-to-end system that can run the real app in a deterministic simulation environment and assert only that the app does not crash.

## Scope

Build these pieces first:

- Mock `AppFileSystem.Service` layer.
- Mock `FetchHttpClient` layer with schema-generated responses through `toArbitrary()`.
- Backend simulation control endpoint.
- Mock LLM provider controlled by the endpoint.
- OpenTUI fake renderer/screen-buffer/interactable-element access.
- Basic action generator that drives the TUI forward.

## Non-Goals

- No semantic graph yet.
- No advanced properties beyond no-crash.
- No fake clock/timer control yet.
- No shrinking yet.
- No broad replacement of app services.

## Decisions

- Load the normal app by default.
- Keep overrides narrow and explicit.
- The first core overrides are `AppFileSystem.Service` and `FetchHttpClient.layer`.
- Do not replace `Provider.Service`, `SessionPrompt.Service`, `ToolRegistry.Service`, or the route tree wholesale unless we prove a narrow seam is impossible.
- Use a backend control endpoint for LLM scripts and simulation state.
- Force `OPENCODE_DB=:memory:` before any code imports `storage/db.ts`.
- Run local simulation under `sandbox-exec` using the old branch setup as the starting point.
- Use `sandbox-exec` as the safety boundary, not as the normal simulated I/O mechanism.
- First built-in property: the app does not crash.

## Target End-To-End Flow

1. Start opencode through the simulation runner.
2. Runner sets `OPENCODE_DB=:memory:` before backend modules load.
3. Runner installs the mock filesystem and mock HTTP client as narrow core overrides.
4. Runner starts under `sandbox-exec` with host writes denied and external network denied.
5. Runner mounts the TUI with a fake OpenTUI renderer instead of a real terminal.
6. Test calls the simulation endpoint to seed filesystem/network/LLM state.
7. Action generator performs one TUI action.
8. Backend handles real app requests and uses endpoint-provided LLM scripts.
9. Runner waits for quiescence.
10. Built-in no-crash property checks TUI and backend errors.

## Mock AppFileSystem

Goal: backend-visible project/config/state files live in memory and never hit the host filesystem.

Implementation shape:

- Add `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation/filesystem.ts`.
- Implement an in-memory filesystem that can back `AppFileSystem.Service`.
- Seed it from JSON fixtures supplied through the simulation endpoint or runner config.
- Serialize it into replay traces.
- Fail unsupported operations with typed simulation errors instead of silently falling back to host FS.
- Enable with `OPENCODE_SIMULATION` for initial startup wiring.
- Use a fixed virtual root, not `process.cwd()`, so host paths are denied by default.
- Use the old branch's Bun preload/plugin redirection only for code paths that bypass `AppFileSystem.Service`.
- Let `sandbox-exec` catch any remaining direct `fs`, `Bun.file`, or process-level filesystem access.

Required capabilities:

- Files and directories.
- Text and binary content.
- Deterministic `stat` metadata.
- Deterministic path resolution for workspace root, cwd, home, config, state, and temp.
- Reads and writes used by tools and config loading.
- Directory listing and recursive traversal for glob/grep equivalents.
- Snapshot/diff support or enough primitives for existing snapshot code to work.

Direct bypass candidates identified so far:

- `tool/read.ts` uses `createReadStream` directly for text line reads.
- `patch/index.ts` uses `fs/promises` and `readFileSync` directly.
- `storage/db.ts` uses sync `fs` APIs and must be protected by forcing `OPENCODE_DB=:memory:` before import.
- `lsp/server.ts`, `util/filesystem.ts`, `file/watcher.ts`, and several CLI/TUI utilities use direct host filesystem APIs.
- These should be redirected only when needed; otherwise `sandbox-exec` should catch leaks.

Todos:

- [x] Inspect `AppFileSystem.Service` interface and all methods used by backend code.
- [x] List direct `@/util/filesystem`, `fs`, and `Bun.file` bypasses that matter in simulation mode.
- [x] Define mock filesystem data model and fixture JSON format.
- [x] Implement the `AppFileSystem.Service` layer.
- [x] Add typed errors for unsupported operations and host-FS escapes.
- [x] Add activation path from startup through `OPENCODE_SIMULATION`.
- [x] Add a tiny fixture that includes `opencode.json`, a workspace root, and a few files.
- [ ] Verify read/glob/grep/write/edit use the mock filesystem.
- [ ] Verify sandbox denies host writes when a bypass is introduced.

## Mock FetchHttpClient

Goal: no backend code makes external network calls. Calls either return generated deterministic mock data or fail with a typed simulation error.

Implementation shape:

- Add `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation/network.ts`.
- Provide a narrow replacement for `FetchHttpClient.layer` / `HttpClient.HttpClient` in simulation startup.
- Allow loopback only when needed for local app/TUI communication.
- Deny all non-loopback network by default.
- Add a response registry controlled by the simulation endpoint.
- For registered schemas, generate deterministic data with `toArbitrary()` and the run seed.

Schema inference problem:

- Raw HTTP requests do not always carry the desired response schema.
- First implementation should find where schema information exists for each network call path.
- If the schema is not available from the raw `HttpClient` call, add a small registry keyed by request matcher and schema.
- The endpoint can register `{ matcher, schema, seedOffset }`, and the mock client can call `toArbitrary(schema)` to generate the response.
- Unknown requests should fail loudly instead of returning generic data.

Network call families found in the first inventory:

- Effect `HttpClient` with schemas close to the call site:
  - `account/account.ts`: opencode account/device/auth/org/user/config APIs. Response schemas are local (`TokenRefresh`, `Org`, `User`, `RemoteConfig`, `DeviceAuth`, `DeviceToken`).
  - `provider/models.ts`: `${OPENCODE_MODELS_URL || "https://models.dev"}/api.json`. Response schema is `Record<string, Provider>` but currently parsed after `res.text`; register this URL to the provider catalog schema.
  - `share/share-next.ts`: share create/sync/remove. Create response schema is `ShareSchema`; sync/remove can be empty/status-only.
  - `skill/discovery.ts`: skill index response schema is `Index`; skill file downloads are raw bytes/text.
  - `session/instruction.ts`: configured remote instruction URLs return text.
  - `tool/mcp-websearch.ts`, `tool/websearch.ts`, and `tool/codesearch.ts`: MCP-style tool calls to Exa/Parallel. Request schemas are local; response shape is MCP JSON-RPC/SSE with `McpResult`.
  - `tool/webfetch.ts`: arbitrary user URL returns raw text/html/image bytes, so it needs explicit registration by URL/content type rather than generic schema generation.
- Effect `HttpClient` that should usually be disabled in first-pass simulation:
  - `installation/index.ts`: update/install metadata.
  - `file/ripgrep.ts`: ripgrep binary download.
  - UI and workspace proxy paths: allow only explicitly registered workspace URLs or loopback/local app traffic.
- Raw `fetch` paths:
  - `config/config.ts`: well-known and remote config fetches. The schema is loose config JSON; register by configured URL if tests need this path.
  - `lsp/server.ts`: language-server release/download fetches. Disable by config in simulation or deny unless explicitly registered.
  - plugin auth/provider helpers (`plugin/codex.ts`, `plugin/github-copilot/*`, CLI commands): not part of first-pass TUI smoke unless explicitly exercised.
- Provider SDK calls:
  - Most model traffic happens inside AI SDK provider packages, not directly through Effect `HttpClient`.
  - First pass should avoid mocking arbitrary provider SDK HTTP. Instead, register a local mock provider/model through the normal provider path and deny provider SDK fetches unless explicitly registered.
- Remote MCP servers:
  - Config `mcp.<name>.url` is the registration point. When the app is given a remote MCP URL, the simulation network should register that URL as an MCP protocol endpoint for that named server.
  - The schema is not a single app schema; it is the MCP JSON-RPC/SSE protocol plus configured tool/resource/prompt definitions. The mock network should handle MCP protocol methods for registered MCP URLs and generate tool/list/call responses from simulation state.
  - The MCP SDK transport may bypass Effect `HttpClient`, so this likely needs either transport-level injection if the SDK supports custom fetch, or the old preload/global `fetch` redirection for registered MCP URLs only.

Registration model:

- `SimulationNetwork.Service` owns a registry keyed by method + URL matcher.
- Registry entries should include a `source`/`kind` so failures explain why a URL was allowed or denied.
- Rough implementation exists at `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation/network.ts`.
- Current rough registry supports exact URL, regex URL, or predicate matchers, optional method filters, parsed request bodies, static responses, dynamic response functions, and full handlers.
- `SimulationNetworkRoutes` imports known schemas from the services that own HTTP call sites and registers schema-backed routes for hardcoded/configurable URL families.
- Configurable/client-provided URLs should be registered through route-family helpers, e.g. `account(baseUrl)`, `models(baseUrl)`, `share(baseUrl)`, `skills(baseUrl)`, and `installation(registryUrl)`.
- Some production schemas are too broad for `Schema.toArbitrary()` today, such as provider catalog fields containing arbitrary mutable JSON. For those cases, the first-pass route can use a narrower generated schema whose values still decode under the production schema.
- Supported entry kinds for the first pass:
  - `jsonSchema`: generate JSON from an Effect `Schema` via `toArbitrary()`.
  - `text`: return deterministic text/html/markdown content for exact URLs.
  - `bytes`: return deterministic binary content for exact URLs.
  - `status`: return empty/status-only responses.
  - `handler`: inspect method, URL, headers, and parsed body to build a custom response.
  - `mcp`: handle JSON-RPC/SSE MCP protocol for a configured MCP server URL.
  - `loopback`: allow local app/TUI traffic only.
- Prefer explicit registration at configuration/control boundaries over guessing from arbitrary URLs:
  - Account/server URL registrations come from account/auth setup.
  - MCP URL registrations come from `config.mcp`.
  - Web fetch/search URLs come from the simulation control endpoint or generated tool action.
  - Provider model responses come from the mock provider script registry, not generic provider SDK HTTP.
- Unknown non-loopback URLs fail with a typed simulation network error.

Layering caveat:

- Several `defaultLayer`s still provide `FetchHttpClient.layer` internally (`Account`, `ModelsDev`, `ToolRegistry`, `ShareNext`, `SkillDiscovery`, `Instruction`, `Installation`, `Ripgrep`, `Workspace`). A top-level `HttpClient.HttpClient` mock does not necessarily affect those self-contained default layers.
- First-pass startup wiring must either use non-default service layers and provide `SimulationNetwork.layer` once, or make these default layers explicitly mock-aware.
- The same caveat already exists for `AppFileSystem.defaultLayer` in some default layers, so the final simulation startup needs an explicit “normal app with narrow mock boundaries” layer assembly rather than blindly using all default layers.

Todos:

- [x] Locate all backend uses of `HttpClient.HttpClient`, raw `fetch`, provider SDK fetches, webfetch/websearch/share/update paths.
- [x] Classify first-pass network call families into schema-generated, text/bytes, MCP protocol, loopback, and denied.
- [x] Decide where `toArbitrary()` lives or which package exports it.
- [x] Define rough request matcher shape: exact URL, regex URL, or predicate.
- [x] Add method-aware matching and parsed request body support.
- [x] Define rough schema registration shape for generated responses.
- [x] Add schema-backed route helpers for hardcoded and configurable URL families.
- [ ] Define final schema registration shape for generated responses.
- [ ] Define MCP URL registration from `config.mcp.<name>.url` to an MCP protocol handler.
- [x] Implement rough seeded response generation with `Schema.toArbitrary()`.
- [x] Add loopback allowlist handling.
- [x] Add typed simulation error for unregistered non-loopback request.
- [ ] Verify sandbox also blocks external network if mock client is bypassed.

## Control Endpoint And Mock LLM Provider

Goal: tests control backend behavior through an endpoint, and the model follows endpoint-provided scripts through the real prompt/session pipeline.

Implementation shape:

- Add simulation control state under `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation/service.ts`.
- Add HTTP routes under a simulation-gated path like `/experimental/simulation/*`.
- Keep the route inaccessible unless simulation mode is explicitly enabled.
- First pass uses a raw route wrapper at `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/instance/httpapi/simulation.ts` to avoid SDK regeneration while the API shape is still moving.
- Current control service can reset state, seed filesystem files, register static network responses, and return a snapshot.
- Register/configure a local mock provider/model through the normal provider path.
- The simulated route graph replaces `Provider.Service` with `SimulationProvider.layer`.
- The mock model reads queued scripts from simulation control state.
- Current mock provider supports text/thinking/error actions for the first step only. Tool calls and multi-round step selection are still pending.
- No JSON-in-prompt fallback.
- Missing script means typed simulation error.

Initial endpoints:

- `POST /experimental/simulation/reset`
- `POST /experimental/simulation/filesystem/seed`
- `POST /experimental/simulation/network/register`
- `POST /experimental/simulation/llm/enqueue`
- `GET /experimental/simulation/snapshot`

Initial LLM script:

```ts
type LLMScriptAction =
  | { type: "text"; content: string }
  | { type: "thinking"; content: string }
  | { type: "tool_call"; name: string; input: Record<string, unknown> }
  | { type: "list_tools" }
  | { type: "error"; message: string }

type LLMScript = {
  steps: LLMScriptAction[][]
  usage?: { inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number; totalTokens: number }
  finish?: "stop" | "tool-calls" | "error" | "length" | "unknown"
}
```

Keep the old useful rule: step `0` runs before tool results, step `N` runs after `N` tool-result rounds.

Todos:

- [x] Define simulation mode activation flag/env.
- [x] Add simulation control state and reset semantics.
- [x] Add gated simulation endpoints for reset, filesystem seed, network register, and snapshot.
- [x] Decide raw route vs typed HttpApi route. Raw route for first pass; no SDK regeneration yet.
- [x] Implement mock provider/model on the normal provider path.
- [x] Make missing scripts fail with a typed simulation error.
- [x] Record consumed script count in simulation snapshot.
- [ ] Support tool-call script actions.
- [ ] Support multi-step script selection after tool result rounds.
- [ ] Verify `session.prompt_async` exercises real `SessionPrompt` and `SessionProcessor`.

## OpenTUI Fake Renderer And Interactable Elements

Goal: run the TUI without a real terminal, inspect the screen buffer, and discover/act on interactable elements.

Known starting points:

- Current TUI creates a real renderer in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/app.tsx` through `createCliRenderer(...)`.
- Existing tests use `@opentui/solid` `testRender(...)`.
- Existing tests use `@opentui/core/testing` `createTestRenderer(...)` for renderer snapshots.

Implementation shape:

- Add a renderer factory/testing hook to `tui(...)` so tests can pass a fake renderer.
- Current first pass checks `OPENCODE_SIMULATION` in `cli/cmd/tui/thread.ts`, starts the normal worker/backend, and injects an OpenTUI test renderer into `tui(...)`.
- Fake renderer setup lives in `cli/cmd/tui/simulation.ts` and returns `renderOnce`, `screen`, and `spans` helpers for the thread-side simulation runner.
- Initial action discovery lives in `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation/actions.ts`.
- OpenTUI exposes `renderer.root` for walking renderables, `Renderable.focusable`, `renderer.currentFocusedEditor`, `renderer.hitTest(...)`, and test `mockInput` / `mockMouse` APIs for execution.
- Do not render to a real terminal in simulation mode.
- Investigate OpenTUI APIs for walking the render tree and extracting focusable/clickable/editable elements.
- Investigate OpenTUI APIs for reading the screen buffer from the fake renderer.
- If OpenTUI does not expose enough semantic information, add a small TUI semantic registry later. Do not block first pass on a full registry.

Todos:

- [x] Inspect `@opentui/core/testing` `createTestRenderer` capabilities.
- [x] Inspect `@opentui/solid` `testRender` capabilities.
- [x] Determine how to get a screen buffer string/snapshot from the fake renderer.
- [x] Determine first structured capture API for interactable discovery: `captureSpans()`.
- [x] Add first pass renderable-based interactable discovery for focused editors, focusable elements, and mouse handlers.
- [x] Add a minimal renderer factory override to `tui(...)` or app startup.
- [ ] Expose prompt ref, route, sync state, keymap, and renderer to the simulation harness.
- [ ] Verify TUI starts in fake renderer with no real terminal output.
- [ ] Verify screen buffer can be captured after a render.

## Basic Action Generator

Goal: drive the TUI forward with generated actions and assert only that the app does not crash.

Implementation shape:

- Add a seeded action generator under `packages/opencode/test/property` or `packages/opencode/src/testing/simulation` depending on whether it needs production imports.
- Start with a tiny action set: submit prompt, key command, paste/type text, click/select visible interactable.
- Prefer OpenTUI/fake-renderer interactions over direct component refs where possible.
- Allow direct prompt ref use for the very first smoke path if OpenTUI interaction APIs are not ready.
- After each action, wait for basic quiescence.
- Built-in property is only `app.does-not-crash`.

Initial no-crash check:

```ts
property({
  name: "app.does-not-crash",
  domains: ["tui", "backend"],
  async check(ctx) {
    ctx.expect(ctx.tui.errors).toEqual([])
    ctx.expect(ctx.backend.errors).toEqual([])
  },
})
```

Todos:

- [ ] Define `UIAction` union for the first pass.
- [ ] Implement seeded RNG for action selection.
- [ ] Generate ordinary prompt text and enqueue matching LLM scripts through the control endpoint.
- [ ] Execute actions through fake renderer/OpenTUI APIs where available.
- [ ] Add temporary prompt-ref execution path if needed for first smoke.
- [ ] Wait for quiescence after each action.
- [ ] Capture screen buffer and backend snapshot after each action.
- [ ] Check only `app.does-not-crash`.
- [ ] Persist a simple replay trace with seed, filesystem fixture, network registrations, LLM scripts, actions, and observations.

## First Milestone

The first milestone is one deterministic run that:

- Starts under `sandbox-exec`.
- Uses `OPENCODE_DB=:memory:`.
- Seeds the mock filesystem.
- Mounts the TUI using a fake renderer.
- Enqueues an LLM script through the control endpoint.
- Submits an ordinary prompt through the TUI.
- Receives a mocked model response through the real session pipeline.
- Captures a screen buffer.
- Passes the no-crash property.

## First-Pass Todos

- [x] Mock filesystem layer works.
- [ ] Mock FetchHttpClient works for registered schemas and fails unknown network. Rough static registry is implemented; schema generation remains.
- [ ] Control endpoint can seed filesystem, register network schemas, enqueue LLM scripts, and snapshot state.
- [ ] Mock provider/model consumes endpoint scripts through the real LLM path.
- [ ] TUI runs with fake renderer.
- [ ] Runner can inspect screen buffer.
- [ ] Runner can identify at least one interactable path to submit a prompt.
- [ ] Basic action generator executes multiple deterministic steps.
- [ ] No-crash property runs after each step.
- [ ] Replay trace is written outside the sandbox.
